# Baseline Design - Working Two-Board System

This folder contains complete documentation of the proven, functional two-board AeroJudge system.

## Purpose
This is the reference baseline that the single-board design must replicate. All functionality shown here must be preserved.

## Folder Structure

### working_two_board/
Complete documentation of the current working system.

**photos/** - Visual reference of functional hardware
- Main board assembly
- Power board with sub-modules
- Interconnections and wiring
- Connector details

**kicad_files/** - Circuit designs with complete component information
- Main board schematic and layout
- Power board schematic and layout
- All component values and part numbers added

**BOM_notes.md** - Consolidated bill of materials from emails and purchase records

### functional_description.md
What the system does and how it works:
- Main board functions
- Power board functions  
- How boards communicate
- All inputs and outputs
- Performance specifications

## Why This Matters
Previous contractor failures stemmed from assumptions made to fill gaps in the baseline documentation. This complete reference ensures the single-board design replicates proven functionality with zero ambiguity.
