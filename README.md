# AeroJudge PCB Production Project

Professional production-ready single-board design for community based AeroJudge aerobatic scoring system.

## Repository Structure

### 01_baseline_design/
Working two-board system documentation - the proven baseline that must be replicated.
- Photos of functional hardware
- KiCad files with complete component information
- BOM and functional description

### 02_requirements/
Complete requirements and constraints for single-board design.
- Functional requirements
- Physical constraints
- Manufacturing specifications
- Connector details

### 03_single_board_design/
Final single-board design files from professional PCB design firm.
- Will be populated during Phase 2

## Approach

**Phase 1 (Current):** Organized complete documentation package
- Document working two-board baseline
- Create comprehensive requirements
- Prepare professional handoff package

**Phase 2 (Next):** Professional PCB design firm execution
- Circuit verification and component selection
- PCB layout with milestone reviews
- Manufacturing-ready files guaranteed for JLCPCB

## Goal
Deliver production-ready single Raspberry Pi HAT that:
- Replicates proven two-board functionality
- Minimizes hand assembly through PCBA service
- Meets all physical constraints for existing case
- Restores customer confidence through reliable delivery

## Timeline
- 1-2 weeks with professional firm
- Manufacturing: 2-3 weeks
- Total: 4-6 weeks to working units
